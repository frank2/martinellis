Martinellis package
===================
              
The root of the Martinellis package comes with a few helper functions to assist
the functionality of the underlying modules. They're not necessarily related to
CIDR functionality, but are very helpful for randomizing and iterating over large
datasets without blowing up memory!

.. autofunction:: martinellis.randiter
                  
.. autofunction:: martinellis.xrandrange
                                    
.. autofunction:: martinellis.xlongrange
